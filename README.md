# sshz

sshz is a minimal, transport-agnostic SSH client and server library written in
Zig. Applications drive its asynchronous state machines over any reliable,
ordered byte stream.

## Features

- Client and server APIs with no internal transport I/O
- Client keyboard-interactive plus client/server public-key, password, and none authentication
- Multiple channels, sessions, port forwarding, and agent forwarding
- Rekeying, delayed compression, resource limits, and deadline enforcement
- Explicit acknowledged keepalives with owned request tokens and transport-flush accounting
- Client-side cancellation of queued, unframed channel data without closing the channel
- Opt-in automatic exec acknowledgment, independent of output and command exit results
- Opt-in server PTY admission and EOF observation, manual receive credit,
  extended output, and owned exit-status/signal submission
- Interoperability coverage with OpenSSH, Dropbear, and libssh

The authoritative algorithm list and negotiation rules are in the
[SSH algorithm policy](doc/algorithm-policy.md).

## Quick start

sshz requires [Zig 0.17.0](https://ziglang.org/download/).

Zlib remains the same pinned, bundled static library. Its stream bindings are
generated with the pinned `cataggar/translate-c` 2.0.0 and GitHub Aro mirror.
Android consumers may still replace the module's single bundled-library link
and include edge with the NDK/system `z` library; header translation itself
does not require the NDK. The 0.2.1 channel/authentication contracts are unchanged.

```sh
zig build test
zig build production-examples
```

See [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) for library commands and the
`sshz` and `sshzd` demo programs.

For either role, consume-readiness counts cover only the current incremental
read. Leave coalesced following packets in the transport or your own input
buffer until requested; see the [transport pump contract](doc/api-production.md#the-transport-pump).

## Project status

> **Security and support warning:** No independent external security review has
> occurred. sshz is pre-1.0 and unsupported for production use while the
> documented release blockers and evidence gaps remain.

The 2026-08-21 [maintainer-led security review](doc/maintainer-security-review-2026-08-21.md)
found and remediated security defects, but it is not an independent review or
production approval. The
[release checklist](doc/release-checklist.md) defines the evidence and review
required for a supported release. `sshz` and `sshzd` are interoperability demos,
not deployment templates. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for private
vulnerability reporting.
